# Tourista---Summer-Project
It is a summer project made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS. 
It is a tours and travels website which consists of various funationalities where the tour packages along with itinerary is displayed.
The users can directly book flight tickets from the website as it has been integrated with API keys.
The website is not completely responsive apparently.

I request you to kindly transfer all the destinations image folders to the images folder after cloning or downloading the reposirtory.
